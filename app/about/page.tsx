        In 2022, I was awarded over <span className="text-white">$300,000</span> in scholarships to attend <span className="text-white">Smith College</span> and study <span className="text-white">Computer Science</span>. 
        By 2023, I had joined a research team in <span className="text-white">computer science education</span>, working with <span className="text-white">Pablo Frank Bolton and Liberty Lehr</span> as the teamâ€™s <span className="text-white">statistician</span>. We investigated a more effective way to assess STEM students, developing the <span className="text-white">Justified Multiple Choice Question (JMCQ) Effect</span>. Our research was recognized by the <span className="text-white">American Society of Engineering Education</span>, where we presented our findings.

        While I was deep into computer science, I couldnâ€™t shake my long-standing interest in <span className="text-white">finance</span>. So in <span className="text-white">Spring 2023</span>, I took my first step into the field through <span className="text-white">stock pitch competitions</span>. 
        Along the way, I worked under the mentorship of a former <span className="text-white">Morgan Stanley VP</span>, gaining insights into unconventional approaches to <span className="text-white">equity research</span>. This experience sharpened my ability to blend <span className="text-white">quantitative and qualitative analysis</span>.

        In the summer of 2023, I started doing something that changed my life: <span className="text-white">creating content</span>. What started as a simple way to share my love for <span className="text-white">computer science</span> on TikTok quickly turned into a movement, reaching <span className="text-white">millions of people</span> around the world.  
        Soon after, I founded <span className="text-white">Computer Science Girlies</span>, a vibrant community dedicated to supporting young women in tech.

        In Summer 2024, I immersed myself in the world of <span className="text-white">startups</span> and <span className="text-white">AI</span>. I joined <span className="text-white">The Residency</span>, a startup incubator, while living at <span className="text-white">Harvard St. Commons</span>. At the same time, I started studying <span className="text-white">Machine Learning</span> at <span className="text-white">MITâ€™s Breakthrough Tech</span>, a program that continues to push my technical expertise forward.

        In Summer 2025, Iâ€™ll be bringing all of these perspectives together as a <span className="text-white">Product Management Intern at MongoDB</span>. Iâ€™m especially excited about their advancements in <span className="text-white">AI and vector search</span>, and I canâ€™t wait to contribute to the next wave of AI-powered innovation.  
        Whatever comes next, one thing is certainâ€”Iâ€™ll keep building, learning, and finding new ways to make an impact.
