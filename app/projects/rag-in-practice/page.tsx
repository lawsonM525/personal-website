            <p className="text-gray-400 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT give more accurate answers by connecting them to external knowledge sources.

              LLMs are great at generating text, but they sometimes "hallucinate" or provide inaccurate information. RAG fixes this by using mathematical techniques like vector embeddings and cosine similarity metrics to connect LLMs to the relevant sections of external databases.

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How RAG Works</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-400">
          RAG systems follow three main steps:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-400 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> The system searches for relevant information by converting both the query and potential answers into mathematical vectors. It then calculates which vectors are closest in multi-dimensional space using cosine similarity.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> The retrieved information is added to your question using ranking algorithms to prioritize the most relevant content. This can be a simple rule-based algorithm or a more complex ML model.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Generation:</strong> The model uses probability distributions to predict the best response, considering both its training and the retrieved context. This mathematical approach ensures the most relevant information is used in the final answer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">
          RAG systems can work with different types of data, like plain text, PDFs, or even databases. For example, when working with a PDF, the system might extract tables or use code to query the data.

        <p className="text-gray-400">
          RAG is not the only way to improve LLMs. Here are three common methods:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> Involves writing better questions or prompts to guide the model. For example, adding "Explain it step by step" to a math question.</li>
          <li><strong>Fine-Tuning (FT):</strong> Involves retraining the model with new data to improve specific skills. For instance, training the model with medical data to answer health-related questions.</li>
          <li><strong>RAG:</strong> Uses external sources to give the model real-time access to new information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">
          Each method has its strengths. Prompt engineering is quick and simple. Fine-tuning creates highly specialized models. RAG is flexible and provides up-to-date information.

            <p className="text-gray-400">
            RAG works by converting text into vectors (embeddings) in a multi-dimensional space using algorithms like <strong>Word2Vec</strong>. </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400">Word2Vec, for example, is a two-layer neural network that processes text by taking in batches of raw textual data, analyzing the relationships between words, and producing a vector space with several hundred dimensions. In this space, similar words or phrases are represented as vectors that are close together.</p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-gray-400">For instance, the phrase <i> "tall building"</i> might be represented as [0.8, 0.3, 0.9], while the word <i>"skyscraper"</i> could become [0.9, 0.2, 0.8]. The closeness of these vectors in the multi-dimensional space shows their semantic similarity. This numerical representation enables mathematical comparison of 
            text similarity using metrics like <strong><i>cosine similarity</i></strong>. By leveraging such embeddings, RAG can efficiently retrieve and compare relevant data.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              When a query vector (user input) is compared against a database of vectors, RAG follows these steps:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-400 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Compute the similarity scores using cosine similarity</li>

            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              The above was a simple rule-based algorithm. If we want to refine the similarity scores, RAG can use:
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md my-4">

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">1. Attention Mechanism</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400">
              The attention mechanism is a key component of transformers, calculating how much focus to put on different parts of the input. The formula for attention uses the softmax function we just described:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md my-2 font-mono text-sm">
              Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T)/âd_k)V

            <p className="text-gray-400">
              Where Q (Query), K (Key), and V (Value) are matrices, and d_k is the dimension of the keys. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in context.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">2. Loss Functions</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400">
              LLMs typically use cross-entropy loss for training, which measures the difference between predicted and actual word probabilities:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md my-2 font-mono text-sm">
              Loss = -Î£ y_true * log(y_pred)

            <p className="text-gray-400">
              Where y_true is the actual word distribution and y_pred is the model's prediction. This helps the model learn to predict the next word accurately.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">3. Position Encoding</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400">
              To maintain word order information, transformers use positional encodings:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md my-2 font-mono text-sm">
              PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
              PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
            </div>
            <p className="text-gray-400">

          â¢ Data Analyst Job Descriptions: Similar to LinkedIn jobs data set but focused on data analyst jobs
          
          â¢ Reddit Career Guidance Subreddit: I scraped 1,000 posts from this subreddit, where people share real-world career advice and stories.
          
          â¢ Twitter Posts: Scraped approximately 200 tweets gathered under keywords like "career tips," "intern tips," and "career guidance."
          
          While the datasets were small due to time and cost constraints (API scraping tools are very pricey!), they provided a solid foundation.`}

          1. Vectorizing the User Profile: The user profile is transformed into a vector using the same process as the datasets.
          
          2. Querying Pinecone: The vectorized profile is sent as a query to Pinecone. Pinecone compares this query using cosine similarity.
          
          3. Selecting Relevant Data: Pinecone ranks the top matches by cosine similarity. We take the top 5 most similar records as the most relevant career data.`}

          For the first time, I wasn't just codingâI truly understood the math behind the models and what good results look like mathematically. Seeing theory come to life and putting it into practice was so exciting.
          
          I'm proud of what I built and excited for the future because I believe Future U can genuinely help students like me find the career guidance they need. This project has shown me what's possible when you combine learning, research, and real-world applications.`}
